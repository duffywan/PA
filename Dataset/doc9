This week is pretty busy. Florence + The Machine release another spellbinding album, pop and R&B sensation Jason Derulo goes further into the retro-eighties realm, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard team up for a collection of duets, the xxâ€™s Jamie xx sort of goes solo, the Barenaked Ladies release album number 13, Ben Lee celebrates twenty years in the business by releasing a collection of low-key pop-rock and Indigo Girls show some impressive range. Musically speaking, June is off to an excellent start.
